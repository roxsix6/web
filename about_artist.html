          I work on creating images of monsters.
        </p>  
        <p style=" font-size: 12px;">
          My work began from the thought that “humans are like monsters.”
          In the online world, people blurt out words without distinguishing between what should and shouldn't be said.
          They assume that others think the same way they do, force their opinions onto others,
          and if their thoughts don't align, they are quick to criticize.
          I started wondering what it would be like to express such humans by giving them monstrous forms.
          At first, I used to gather their negative traits and create new shapes from them.
          But at some point, I realized that not only negative aspects,
          but also positive traits were appearing in my drawings.
          It was a moment when I came to understand that the world isn’t just full of bad people.
          Still, I continue this kind of work—
          and I often wonder if it's due to my own personality.
        </p>
        <p style=" font-size: 12px;">
          There's a saying that others are the most accurate mirror that reflects ourselves.
          Perhaps the behavior I hate most—imposing thoughts on others,
          assuming that others must think the same as I do—
          may have been my own flaw all along.
        </p>
        <p style=" font-size: 12px;">
          Perfectionism is the belief that there is always a better, more perfect state worth striving for.
          It involves setting high standards for oneself to achieve a greater sense of accomplishment,
          and it is often defined as a desire for order and organization.
          People who hold this belief or mindset are called perfectionists.
          This tendency is often referred to as having a perfectionist personality.
        </p>
        <p style=" font-size: 12px;">
          I am far from perfect. I constantly push myself in the hope of becoming perfect,
          yet the result is always lacking.
          But I don’t see this tendency as entirely bad—
          in fact, this moderate self-discipline helps me to work and complete things.
          However, this desire to be perfect has slowly started affecting others too.
          I’ve come to expect ideal behavior from others,
          and I’ve often been disappointed when they didn’t meet the image I had arbitrarily created of them.
        </p>
        <p style=" font-size: 12px;">
          I spent a lot of time wondering why I kept making these kinds of mistakes and wrong assumptions.
          I thought—maybe it’s because we all share the same species,
          with similar eyes, noses, mouths, and ears?
          Of course, some people have bigger eyes, others have thicker earlobes—
          and if you look closely, you’ll see plenty of differences.
          But even within humanity, when we encounter different races,
          we often can’t tell the differences and say “they all look the same.”
          We say things like “we’re all different” or “being different is not wrong,”
          but I started to wonder if our instincts tell a different story.
        </p>
        <p style=" font-size: 12px;">
          Through my work of crafting new outer shells for others,
          I want to question how well we really know someone,
          and whether the version you think you know is truly all there is to them.
        </p>
        <p style=" font-size: 12px;">
          My usual process begins by encountering a stranger by chance.
          Without closely observing the person’s appearance,
          I try to understand them through conversation or by watching from afar,
          and draw a monstrous form based not on their external looks
          but as far removed as possible from the idea of an ideal human being.
        </p>
        <p style=" font-size: 12px;">
          We often despair when we fall short of some ideal human we aspire to become,
          and we pressure others to follow that same ideal.
          Through my work, I want to give people new outer shells—
          not the conventional ones, but ones that are visually unique and diverse.
